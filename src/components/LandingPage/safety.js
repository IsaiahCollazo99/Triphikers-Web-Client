				<p>
					Each country has a high season, a low season, and in between
					season.Those in between season are know as "shoulder seasons" and they
					generally offer the ideal mix of affordability and comfort.Shoulder
					seasons roughly coincide with spring and fall. the shoulder seasons
					are the transitional periods between the rainy and dry seasons. Before
					you make any decision of your destination, you should check the
					climate

				<h2 className="safetySubTitle">Study Up on the Local Authorities</h2>

				<p>
					Before you visit any country, do some research into the
					trustworthiness of local civil authorities like police, emergency
					services Before you arrive at your destination, check whether the
					country or city you’re visiting has tourist police and plan
					accordingly.

				<h2 className="safetySubTitle">Purchase Travel Insurance</h2>
				<p>
					Travel insurance is great for groups large and small, but it’s
					especially helpful for solo travelers. If you’re planning to travel
					abroad, especially if your itinerary involves long-distance hiking in
					remote areas or other risky activities, make sure your policy has
					medical evacuation coverage. Medical airlifts (air ambulances) are
					incredibly expensive.

				<h2 className="safetySubTitle"> Protect Your Money and Valuables</h2>
				<p>
					Protecting Your Money and Valuables The first rule of preventing theft
					while traveling abroad: Never carry more money than you need at one
					time. If you’re spending two weeks abroad, don’t carry a two-week
					supply of cash every time you leave your room. The second rule: Secure
					your money, cards, and valuables in something other than a back pocket
					or flimsy wallet. For cash, get a money belt that straps securely to
					your waist and can’t easily be separated from your clothing. Quality
					models start at $15 apiece. For your cards, get an RFID-blocking
					wallet that stymies EMV chip card scanners, which high-tech
					pickpockets use to lift credit card data from passersby in public
					places. My RFID-blocking wallet cost less than $20 and looks great –
					it’s not actual leather, but I certainly can’t tell the difference.

				<h2 className="safetySubTitle"> Be Discreet With Accessories </h2>
				<p>
					Flashing shiny, spendy accessories is a surefire way to attract the
					wrong kind of attention. Avoid displaying expensive-looking jewelry,
					handbags, sunglasses, and other accessories on the road. In fact,
					unless you’re traveling for business and need to dress to impress,
					there’s little reason to even bring such accessories on your trip. If
					you do need to sport name brands at an evening function or two, that’s
					fine – just dress down for the rest of your trip and leave the
					expensive stuff tucked safely away in your room.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div className="safetyCard">
				<h2 className="safetySubTitle">Reserve Secure Room Locker </h2>
				<p>
					Use Your Room Safe or Reserve a Secure Locker Speaking of room
					storage: If you have a room safe, use it to store anything you really
					don’t want stolen. Yes, that means expensive jewelry and accessories –
					if you brought them, and if they’re small enough to fit in the safe.
					It also means your excess cash, credit and debit cards, and (when
					abroad) essential travel documents like your passport and visa. For
					obvious reasons, you don’t want to carry extra cash around in an
					unfamiliar city, and losing your passport is a major inconvenience
					that usually necessitates an in-person visit to the nearest embassy or
					consulate.

					Skip the International Calling Plan{" "}
				</h2>
				<p>
					Skip the International Calling Plan Unless you’re traveling for
					business and absolutely need to have on-demand calling capabilities,
					don’t bother with your wireless provider’s international calling plan.
					They typically carry steep per-minute call fees – $0.20 and up – or
					hefty per-day fees. My provider, Verizon, charges $5 per day, per line
					in Canada and Mexico, and $10 per day, per line elsewhere. Use a free
					or super-cheap talk and text app instead: WhatsApp, Line, Viber, or
					any other app you prefer Most work wherever Wi-Fi is available, so you
					shouldn’t need to connect to any local wireless networks. Check ahead
					with your hotel or hostel to make sure you can get reliable Wi-Fi
					there, ideally for free. This isn’t
				</p>

			<div className="safetyCard">
				<h2 className="safetySubTitle"> Reach Out to Other Solo Travelers </h2>
				<p>
					Reach out to other solo travelers heading your way. Why waste time
					finding your compatriots and breaking the ice when you can get that
					out of the way ahead of time? The easiest way to find other singles in
					your destination is to join an online group (Facebook groups tend to
					be the most accessible and well-traveled) for solo travelers. Many
					groups, like Girls LOVE Travel, cater specifically to women travelers.
					Use these resources to poll more seasoned women travelers about their
					experiences abroad, paying special attention to geographic areas to be
					avoided or unfamiliar cultural norms to watch for. Don’t be afraid of
					sounding paranoid or overcautious. 16. Register With Your Home
					Country’s Diplomatic Corps When you travel abroad, register with your
					home country’s diplomatic corps. For U.S. citizens, that’s the State
					Department, the official arbiter of international travel safety for
					U.S. citizens. This is especially important in countries known for
					crime or political instability. Dozens of countries are covered in
					part or whole by State Department travel warnings, including popular
					U.S. tourist destinations like Mexico. You don’t need to show up at
					the embassy in person unless you need assistance. Just reach out to
					the appropriate contact before you leave the U.S. You can also
					register your trip with the State Department before you depart – my
					wife and I did this before a recent trip to Costa Rica, and we were
					shocked at how easy it was. If any issues arise on your trip, local
					embassy or consulate staff will know where you are and how to get in
					touch with you.

					Share Your Itinerary With Friends and Family
				</h2>
				<p>
					Share Your Itinerary With Friends and Family (Not on Social Media)
					When you travel alone, even on a quick weekend jaunt to a relatively
					safe U.S. city like Seattle or Portland, make sure someone else knows
					where you’re going. This could be a sibling, a parent, a close friend,
					or a domestic partner (if they’re not traveling with you). The most
					important criteria: You trust them to have your back if and when you
					need their help. Also, tempting as it may be, don’t announce solo
					travels in advance on social media. You can’t be sure who’s checking
					your posts. Wait to post pictures and reminiscences once you’re safely
					back home.
